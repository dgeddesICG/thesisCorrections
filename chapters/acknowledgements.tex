Firstly, I'd like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Andrew R. Harvey for his continued support, and patience, throughout this research and the completion of this thesis. Beyond giving me the opportunity to carry out this research, he entertained my tendencies to turn everything into an overly convoluted mathematics problem, and mentored me to become the researcher I am today. \\
I feel incredibly fortunate to say that there are too many beloved family members and friends to thank here - their support helped me persevere through long evenings in the lab and laboured writing sessions. I'd like to thank my Mum, Carol, for continuously feeding my curiosities while I was growing up, and for her continued love and support throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. 
To the friends that helped proof read this thesis and endured my unrelenting moaning and complaining about my research during days out rock climbing or trips to the pub - thank you for sticking by me. I am looking forward to having more time to spend with everyone of you.\\
I am also grateful to the funders of this research - OPTOS Plc, and CENSIS.
