\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter the process of modifying an off-the-shelf fundus camera for Spectral - Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging using a standard science (sCMOS) camera and Horiba FLIMera for fluorescence lifetime imaging. A safety assessment is described which outlines safe operating procedures for imaging \textit{in-vivo} human retinas. The spectral response of the instrument is then measured and the process of calibrating the malfunction pixels and temporally misalignment between pixels of the FLIMera are described. Finally, the spatial resolution of the instrument is measured using the slanted edge test giving a resolution of \qty{50}{\um} for the sCMOS detector and \qty{214}{\um} for the brightfield detector and FLIMera.

\subsection{S-FLIO System Design Methodology}
As outlined in \cref{sec:objresearch} the purpose of this project is to use the principles of fluorescence lifetime imaging and spectral fluorescence imaging to further develop capabilities of chemical sensing in the retina. This was achieved using an off-the-shelf fundus camera modified to enable spectrally-resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements of the retina with a FOV wide enough to span the fovea (\qty{20}{\degree})
While this field-of-view is generally considered to be narrow in ophthalmic imaging - existing point scanning systems can image \qty{82}{\percent} of the retinal surface or a (\qty{200}{\degree} FOV~\cite{kato2019quantitative}) - this device is to serve as a prototype to establish the efficacy this new imaging technique. To image a larger field-of-view multiple exposure would be recorded of the eye over multiple fixation points and stitched together. The total-image acquisition time is also a key constraint in designing a retinal imaging device for routine clinical assessments. 
In fluorescence lifetime imaging of the retina the safe exposure of the excitation source and the poor quantum efficiency of the retina results in a high-noise and photon starved environment.
For the proposed S-FLIO device the excitation and imaging bands are be optimised to enhance the detection, and discrimination, of key fluorescent retinal biomarkers - FAD, AGE, A2E. New generation SPAD arrays will allow SFLIM measurements to be recorded in a series of snapshots which in principle can reduce image acquisition times when compared to raster scanned systems.

\subsection{Description of the Conventional Fundus Camera}
The S-FLIO device developed in this project uses an off-the-shelf fundus camera to simplify the design and construction process allowing more time to be spent developing methods of chemical quantification in the retina. This approach also allows for the SFLIO system to be more readily integrated into OPTOS's existing product lines where it could be sold as a standalone system or a modification for existing fundus camera.
The fundus camera can record images over three field-of-views - \qtylist{20;35;50}{\degree} and uses a filtered white-light Xenon flash lamp to record images in either: brightfield, autofluorescence, or fluorescence imaging using fluorescein or indocyanine green dyes for retinal angiography.
The fundus camera can record images over the fields-of-view \qtylist{20;35;50}{\degree} in multiple modalities: brightfield or reflectance imaging; autofluorescence imaging; and fluorescence imaging using an exogenous dye such as fluorescein or indocyanine green in retinal angiography. The retina is illuminated using a tungsten lamp for alignment of the eye or a Xenon flash bulb for recording evenly illuminated images. For both light sources annular illumination, shown in \cref{fig:annularillumination},  is used to separate the illumination and imaging volumes. Reducing this overlap of ray volumes reduces the contamination from back-reflections resulting in a higher quality image. This is the Gullstrand principle~\cite{gullstrand1910neue}.

The modifications made to the illumination arm of the fundus camera for tuneable excitation of retinal fluorescence are described in~\cref{subsec:modifyillum}. Likewise, changes made to the imaging arm to enable spectral-fluorescence lifetime measurements are discussed in~\cref{subsec:modifyimaging}. These modifications are highlighted in~\cref{fig:sflioopticsfull}.

\subsection{Modifications for Illuminating the Retina with Pulsed Super-Continuum Source}\label{subsec:modifyillum}
The SFLIO device excites retinal fluorescence using a pulsed-supercontinuum white-light source (NKT SuperK Ex-12W and Fianium blue-tuned source) tuned into 8 narrow bands ($\text{FWHM} = \qty{1}{\nm}$) with an Acousto-Optically Tuneable Filter (AOTF). Tuning the excitation wavelength, while not thoroughly explored in this thesis, would allow for retinal fluorophores to be targeted using their unique excitation spectra. The fibre output of the AOTF is coupled into the illumination path of the fundus camera by positioning a dichroic mirror in the place of a filter wheel. Wavelengths shorter than \qty{505}{\nm} are reflected into the illumination path and unwanted longer wavelengths are transmitted into the chassis of the fundus camera and absorbed. To match the Numerical Aperture (NA) of the fibre output of the laser the beam is collimated ($\text(diameter)= 1", f = \qty{100}{\mm}$) and refocused ($\text(diameter) = 1", f = \qty{150}{\mm}$) to a point at the perimeter of the annular stop $A_{1}$ of \cref{fig:sfliooptics}. This annular stop is conjugate to the annulus projected on the cornea and results in the excitation of fluorescence over $\qty{20}{\degree}$ of the retina (see \cref{fig:illuminationarea}). While the fundus camera is capable of the imaging over a \SI{50}{\degree} FOV, the combination of long acquisition times required for SFLIO imaging coupled with the limited output power of the supercontinuum light-source meant the area illuminated on the retina would be reduced to minimise geometric losses. \textcolor{red}{add something about what youd do if you wanted to image wider FOVs}

This design approach reduced the illuminated field-of-view on the retina but also minuses the impact of geometric losses from the multiple annular stops blocking the central lobe of the laser beam.
Using a laser with a higher output power would mitigate these geometric losses however this would necessitate more rigorous fail-safe mechanisms in the event of any damage to the annular stops causing unsafe exposure levels.

\subsection{Modifications of Imaging Path for Simultaneous brightfield and S-FLIM imaging.}\label{subsec:modifyimaging}

The imaging arm of the SFLIO instrument uses the Horiba FLIMera SPAD array (referred to as the FLIMera herein) to record fluorescence lifetime data over a $\cong\qty{12}{\degree}$ field-of-view. A separate scientific camera (Thorlabs Kiralux) to records fluorescence intensity or brightfield images over a \qty{35}{\degree} field-of-view to correct for motion of the retina during the long acquisition period. SLR lenses were set up in a relay configuration to collimate the image ($f=\qty{100}{\mm}$) and re-image onto the FLIMera ($f = \qty{50}{\mm}$ ) and sCMOS camera ($f = \qty{85}{\mm}$). A 2” plate beamsplitter transmits \qty{10}{\percent} of the signal to the sCMOS camera and reflects \qty{90}{\percent} to the FLIMera - this maximises the efficiency of the SFLIM measurements without degrading the quality of the registration. Due to the difference in pixel-counts between the two detectors - $\qtyproduct{192 x 126}{\pixel}$ for the FLIMera and \qtyproduct{4096 x 2160}{\pixel} the field-of-view covered by the FLIMera was reduced by a linear factor of $\approx 3$ to improve the spatial resolution of the acquired images with the intention that if SFLIM images of larger areas of the retina the patient can fixate on their eyes away from centre.

A linear carriage of 5 emission bandpass filters is fitted at $f_{2}$ for recording spectrally resolved fluorescence lifetime images. For recording fluorescence co-registration images a $\qty{500}{\nm}$ long-pass filter is placed at $p_{1}$. These spectral filters were chosen to maximise photon throughput and capabilities to discriminate retinal fluorophores (see \cref{sec:tensband}) and the central wavelengths and bandwidths are shown in \cref{tab:sflio-filts}) For \textit{in-vivo} rat imaging filter 4b was not used – resulting in 4 total spectral bands.

\subsection{Assessment for Safely Imaging \textit{in-vivo} Human Retinas}
A critical design requirement for a retinal imaging device is that can should be recorded without damaging patient sight and causing minimal discomfort. In the SFLIO device two similar pulsed-supercontinuum laser sources were used throughout this project which both have the capability of producing broadband light at an intensity capable of causing irreparable damage to sight many times over. A full safety assessment was carried out, in collaboration with OPTOS Plc, to determine the safe exposure levels and the required attenuation of the laser source such that even when operating at the sources maximum intensity the exposure at the retina is safe. Although \textit{in-vivo} imaging of humans retinas was not achieved in this project, this assessment is still useful for determining the clinical efficacy of our device by comparing the laser intensity required for detecting FAD in rats \textit{in-vivo} (\cref{chap:ratfad}) to the safe exposure levels.
\subsubsection{Damage Mechanisms in the Retina - Phototoxic and Photothermal Effects}
When the eye is exposed to light there is two, wavelength dependent, mechanisms from which damage can occur - phototoxic and photothermal damage. Phototoxic damage predominantly occurs at wavelengths $ < \qty{500}{\nm} $ where absorbed photons cause oxidative reactions within the cells of the RPE, choroid, and the retina causing cellular death and with sufficient exposure results in permanent loss of vision~\cite{glickman2002phototoxicity}. Further, in the deep UV range of the spectrum ($<\qty{200}{\nm}$) these absorbed photons can directly cause the breaking of covalent bonds and with pulse lengths shorter than \qty{1}{\micro\second}, tissue can be ablated. This is the mechanism for LASIK surgery where the cornea is reshaped to correct cases of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism~\cite{reinstein2012history}. In photothermal damage, longer wavelength photons cause over heating of the tissue causing the tissue to become necrotic and for severe rapid heating the vitreous humour cavitates at the retina causing lesions~\cite{glickman2002phototoxicity,roberts2001ocular}.
The supercontinuum laser source used in the SFLIO device does not emit light below \qty{400}{\nm} so photochemical ablation was not a concern however the risks due to photochemical oxidation or photothermal damage mechanisms were considered.  The safe exposure thresholds defined by the two established safety standard documents were used to evaluate the safety of the instrument \citeauthor{ISO15004,IEC60825}.

\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Safe Exposure Thresholds for Illuminating the Retina with a \\Pulsed-Supercontinuum Laser}
To evaluate the safety of the SFLIO device two sets of safety standards were utilised: the \citeauthor{ISO15004} standard describes the evaluation of safety for ophthalmic devices categorised as either Group 1 devices where there is no risk of ocular damage and Group 2 where some risk does exist but is still safe to use under strict guidelines; and the \citeauthor{IEC60825} standard which is used to define the safety of laser systems designated from Class 1, which are considered eye-safe, up to Class 4B where even stray reflections from diffuse surfaces can pose a risk to eyesight~\cite{ISO15004, IEC60825}. In the ISO standard the instrument was evaluated against the criteria for a Group 1 continuous wave device due to a clause stating that for total exposures longer than \SI{20}{\second}, the safe exposure limits are the same as if the supercontinuum laser was a continuous wave source. The IEC document was used to evaluate the instrument as a Class 1 pulsed laser source.  The IEC document contains stricter criteria for pulsed sources and, unlike the ISO standard, considers the additional damage mechanisms arising from the use of a short pulse-length and high repetition rate laser source such as micro-cavitation, and self-focusing of the laser beam~\cite{rockwell2010ultrashort}.
A detailed description of the procedure used determine the multiple safe exposure limits are listed in~\cref{app:sfliosafety} however for both standards the exposure limits, the measured exposure, and the resulting safety factor are given and defined here.
\paragraph*{Assessing SFLIO Device Safety Against Criteria for a Group 1 Ophthalmic Device -\citeauthor{ISO15004}}
In the ISO standard the SFLIO instrument is evaluated as a Group 1 device where the exposure limits for this classification are defined in terms of a wavelength dependent irradiance, $E(\lambda)$, pertaining to a particular section of the eye - retina, cornea and lens, and the anterior segment. For each of these sections, where relevant, there are also weighting functions applied to account for the photothermal and photochemical damage mechanisms shown in \cref{fig:safetyspectra}c. In the safety assessment the spectral irradiance is defined using the power spectrum, $P(\lambda)$, and the area illuminated,$A$. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:irrad}
    E(\lambda) = \frac{P(\lambda)}{A} \cong \frac{P_{M}S(\lambda)}{A \int_{0}^{\infty}S(\lambda)d\lambda}
\end{equation}
The power spectrum is measured by composing a measurement the spectra of the light emitted from the fundus camera with a measurement of the emitted power using a optical power meter. The optical power meter applies a wavelength-dependent bias function to overcome the non-uniform response across the visible spectrum. However, the bandwidth of the excitation is sufficiently narrow (FWHM $<\qty{11.5}{\nm}$ - see \ref{fig:safetyspectra}b) that a single power measurement was recorded with the bias function set to be centred on \qty{468}{\nm} - the peak of the excitation.

\end{figure}
The safety thresholds (see \cref{tab:conthresh}) were calculated with the optical power measured when the laser source was set to its maximum output power - $P_{M} = \qty{1.1}{\milli\watt}$ - exceeding the safe exposure limits for a Group 1 device by a factor \num{20}. A neutral density filter with $\text{OD} = \num{1.3}$, calculated using \cref{eq:OD}  was fitted into the illumination arm to attenuate the optical power incident on the retina to eye-safe levels of $P_{M}=\qty{46}{\micro\watt}$ and the safe exposure thresholds were recalculated with a safety factor, $\eta = \nicefrac{\text{Threshold}}{\text{Value}}$.

In the IEC standard the safe exposure limits, Accessible Emission Limits (AEL), were determined for a pulsed Class 1 laser source which is deemed safe for up to 8 hours of continuous exposure in a 24hour period~\cite{IEC60825}. The AELs are calculated in terms of the energy deposited by: a single pulse; a single pulse within a train of pulses - weighted by a safety factor; and the emission from \qty{100}{\second} integrated into a single pulse. The lowest AEL is chosen for evaluation, $\text{AEL}_{s.p.T}$, and is compared against the power incident of $P=\qty{1.3}{\micro\watt}$ and converted to energy deposited per pulse - $E_{pulse} = P/f$ where $f$ is the repetition rate of the source.

\subsubsection{Summary of Safety Assessment}
In this safety assessment the SFLIO device was evaluated using two safety standards where the excitation source is treated as both a continuous wave source, and a pulsed source. To ensure to safe operation for \textit{in-vivo} imaging of human eyes a $\text{OD}=1.3$ neutral density filter was fitted to ensure that the exposure is within the limits set out in both the \citeauthor{ISO15004} and \citeauthor{IEC60825} even when the laser is set to its maximum power output. 
This attenuates the emission produced by the SFLIO device within factors of 1.91 when treating the device as a Class 1 pulsed laser source and 1.24 the instrument is evaluated as a Group 1 continuous wave sourced ophthalmic device under the \citeauthor{ISO15004} and \citeauthor{IEC60825}, respectively. For regular imaging of human retinas these factors should be solely relied upon, and the optical power must be measured regularly

\section{Measurement of Spectral Response of SFLIO Device}

The non-unity spectral response of the imaging optics in the fundus camera and the non-rectangular transmission function of the bandpass filters will negatively influence the accuracy and robustness of recovered fluorophore concentrations. The spectral response of the SFLIO device was characterised using a spectrometer positioned at the image plane of the FLIMera and illuminated by a Xenon broadband white-light source positioned at the objective lens of the fundus camera. Spectra were also measured for each bandpass filter $I_n(\lambda)$ as well as a direct measurement of the Xenon light source.  The transmission function of the SFLIO device for each spectral band, $F_n(\lambda)$ are calculated using the combined response of the Xenon white light source ($D(\lambda)$) and spectrometer ($S(\lambda)$) and these previous measurements $(I_n(\lambda))$(\cref{eq:filtcal,eq:filttrans})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:filttrans}
    F_{n}(\lambda) = \frac{I_{n}(\lambda)}{\alpha(\lambda)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:filtcal}
    S(\lambda)D(\lambda) = \alpha(\lambda)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    I_{n}(\lambda) = S(\lambda)D(\lambda)F_{n}(\lambda)
\end{equation}

In \cref{fig:filtfuncs} the calibrated filter functions are shown after using \cref{eq:filtcal,eq:filttrans} and subtracting dark spectra to remove the influence of scattered background light. The non-uniformity in the spectral response of the fundus camera optics can be attributed to cumulative absorption from the anti-reflective coatings on the lenses within the fundus camera, as well as the SLR lenses and beam splitter in the imaging arm.

\subsection{Characterisation of Horiba FLIMera}
\subsubsection{FLIMera Architecture}
The FLIMera is a \qtyproduct{192 x 126}{\pixel} array of Single Photon Avalanche-Diodes with on-pixel TCSPC modules capable of widefield fluorescence lifetime imaging with \qty{47}{\ps} temporal resolution. Based upon a similar architecture to SPAD array of~\citeauthor{henderson2019192} the FLIMera has a pixel pitch of \qtyproduct{18.4 x 9.2}{\um} of which over half of the photosensitive layer is lost to the TCSPC electronics resulting in a low fill-factor of \qty{13}{\percent}~\cite{henderson2019192}. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width= 0.5\textwidth]{figures/sflio-device/SPADarchitecture.png}

Although this fill-factor is low when compared to traditional imagers it does improve upon the state-of-the-art in TCPSC imagers with a higher fill-factor and a scalable pixel architecture \cite{cusini2022historical,gersbach2010high,ulku2018512}.
Additionally, this fill factor can be improved upon using various established techniques at the fabrication stage. A micro-lens array would focus light incident within a pixel onto the smaller photosensitive area (see \cref{fig:SPADlayout}b) - increasing fill-factor \qty{42}{\percent} in the case of the FLIMera~\cite{henderson2019192}. The fill-factor could also be increased using a multilayered, back-illuminated, architecture (see~\cref{fig:SPADlayout}c)  where the photon counting electronics are on a layer beneath the photosensitive area of the pixel.

\subsubsection{TCSPC Acquisition Modes}
The FLIMera has two acquisition modes: a default mode where a single XYT data cube is recorded over the acquisition window; and the ``raw'' mode where now each photon detection event is streamed from the FLIMera at a rate of \qty{24}{\kilo\hertz} to form ``frames''. These photon records take the form of a 4 byte word which from the least to most significant bit contains the X (\qty{8}{\bit}), Y (\qty{8}{\bit}), and time bin (\qty{10}{\bit}) coordinate of the photon detection. The final \qty{4}{\bit} are used as a frame marker (1111) to denote the next frame in the acquisition or a photon record. This higher frame-rate mode comes at the penalty of larger file where a \qty{2}{\minute} integration time in ``raw'' mode results in a \qty{25}{\giga\byte} compared to the $\approx\qty{25}{\mega\byte}$ of the default acquisition mode. The high frame-rate ``raw'' mode is used to enable motion of the retina to be compensated using high resolution brightfield images recorded at a high enough frame rate to resolve motion of the retina \SI{10}{\hertz} (see \cref{sec:motionreg}).

\subsubsection{FLIMera Characterisation}
The FLIMera used in this project is a pre-production model and exhibits malfunctioning pixels and pixels that are misaligned in the temporal domain. These aberrant pixels need to be characterised and corrected for to ensure the accurate recovery of fluorophore concentrations using the algorithms developed in \cref{chap:tensSFLIM}.
\FloatBarrier
\paragraph*{Dead and Hot Pixel Masking\\}\label{sec:pixelmask}
The FLIMera used in this project is a pre-production model and exhibits malfunctioning pixels. These malfunctioning pixels present as either ``dead'' pixels - and do not produce a signal in response to incident photons - or ``screamers'' which produce a histogram resembling a DC signal. These errant pixels were excluded from analysis of FLIMera images using a pair of binary masks constructed from thresholding (see \cref{fig:pixel}d) the photon counts on two datasets: a uniformly fluorescent microscope slide (THORLABS- FSK4); and a dark frame.

\paragraph*{Correcting for Temporal Misalignment between SPAD's\\}\label{sec:timealign}
Another artefact of the pre-production nature of the FLIMera is the fluorescence decays for each pixel are not aligned in the time axis resulting in improper fitting of fluorescence lifetimes and poor recovery of retinal fluorophore concentrations. Correcting this misalignment can be achieved using a pixel offset mask (see \cref{fig:shiftmap}b) which describes how many time-bins each decay should be shifted by. This mask is produced by finding the time-location of the maxima in each pixel and subtracting it from a reference value which ensures the peak of histogram is shifted to this value.

\subsection{Measurement of Spatial Resolution using Knife Edge Test}
Accurately determining the smallest features or highest spatial frequency that can be resolved by an imaging system can often be an onerous task where best practises are continually updated ~\cite{ISO12233}. In this project only estimates of these factors are required to answer two key questions in assessing the imaging performance of the SFLIO device: Can common retinal features and disease signifiers, on the order of \SI{50}{\um}, such as drusen~\cite{abdelsalam1999drusen} be resolved; and how accurate does the registration between the FLIM and brighfield images need to be.
For assessing these criteria the knife-edge or slanted-edge test is used to measure the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and Line-Spread Function (LSF) of the SFLIO device chosen primarily for its experimental simplicity~\cite{burns2000slanted, ISO12233}.
% Accurately measuring the Modulation Transfer Function,  of an imaging system is often an onerous task where standardised best practises are continually refined~\cite{ISO12233}. In this project only estimates of the MTF are required to determine two factors: If retinal features on the order of \SI{50}{\um} such as drusen~\cite{abdelsalam1999drusen} be resolved; and the required accuracy of the registration between the two detectors such that retinal motion can be compensated. For assessing the spation resolution of the SFLIO device the knife-edge test - often referred to as the slanted-edge test in literature - was chosen for its simplistic experimental procedure~\cite{burns2000slanted, ISO12233}. 
Briefly, this method measures of spatial resolution of a digital imager using an image recorded of a hard-edge positioned in the image plane and rotated a few degrees ($<\qty{10}{\degree}$) either off-vertical or off-horizontal. The FLIMera arm of the SFLIO device is detector limited so this edge appears aliased. Line profiles through the aliased edge are then aligned to produce an Edge-Spread Function (ESF) and the spatial resolution of the system can then be estimated from the LSF (\cref{eq:ESF}) or from the computed MTF. The rotation of the edge in the image plane enables the ESF to be sampled with sub-pixel precision due each line profile - through the edge - being displaced by less than a single pixel in the direction perpendicular to the edge.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ESF}
    ESF(x) = \dv{}{x}LSF(x)
\end{equation}
The Knife-edge test was performed simultaneously on both detectors using an eye phantom where the edge is comprised of a scalpel blade and fluorescent microscope slide (Thorlabs - FSK4) positioned at the retinal plane. The fluorescent slide emits uniform fluorescence that can be excited between \qtyrange{460}{462}{\nm} and imaged using a \qty{500}{\nm} long-pass filter. Integration times of \qty{250}{\ms} and \qty{5}{\second} were chosen for the FLIMera and sCMOS camera to ensure there was sufficient photon flux to record high quality images. This process is shown in~\cref{fig:FIMTFresult,fig:FLMTFResult}, where in the analysis of the knife edge images, the location of the edge, $\tilde{x}$ within the image is first estimated, to the nearest whole pixel, from line profiles, $L(x)$ through the edge using \cref{eq:edgelocest}. Due to the effect of aliasing these locations do not represent the "true" location of the edge and so a straight line is fitted to these edge locations to increase the precision to \qty{0.25}{\pixel}. Line profiles along the entire edge are then aggregated together to form a single ESF upsampled by a factor of $\nicefrac{1}{0.25} = \num{4}$. As above, the LSF and MTF can now be computed from the ESF in terms of cycles-per-pixel. The LSF and MTF for both detectors are then converted to cycles-per-\si{\um} using a image recorded of a 0.05'' (\qty{1.27}{\mm}) Allen key positioned in the phantom eye where it was found one pixel on the FLIMera and sCMOS detector equated to \qty{66}{\um} and \qty{6.3}{\um} respectively. The spatial resolution of the system is determined by the full-width at half-maximum of a Gaussian fitted through the LSF. By fitting a Gaussian through the LSF the influence of quantisation noise is reduced. For the FLIMera the spatial resolution was found to be \qty{214}{\um} and for the sCMOS detector this found to be \qty{50}{\um}. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:edgelocest}
    \tilde{x} = argmax\Bigg\{\abs{\dv{}{x}L(x)}\Bigg\}

\subsection{Assessing Sensitivity of Spatial Resolution with Changing Focus}


% For the SFLIO device the spatial resolution is defined using two metrics – the Point-Spread Function (PSF) and the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The Point-spread function describes how a point source in a scene is blurred in a final image (\cref{eq:psf}) where the full-width at half maximum of the PSF is often used as the metric for a systems spatial resolution.
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:psf}
%     I_{IMAGE}(x,y) = PSF(x,y)\circledast I_{SCENE}(x',y')
% \end{equation}
% The MTF of a system describes the spatial frequency response of the imaging system. The resolution of a system is then either described as where the MTF falls below its maximum value or where the SNR < 1.
% \begin{align}
%     J_{IMAGE}(\nu,\mu) &\approxeq MTF(\nu,\mu)\circledast K_{SCENE}(\nu',\mu')\label{eq:mtf}\\
%     MTF(\nu,\mu) &= \mathcal{F}\{PSF(x,y)\}(\nu,\mu) \label{eq:PSFtoMTF}\\
%     MTF(\nu) &= \mathcal{F}\{LSF(x)\}(\nu)\label{eq:LSFtoMTF}
% \end{align}
When adjusting the focussing knob on the SFLIO device it was observed that near the thought-to-be optimal focus the change in image sharpness on the FLIMera was insensitive to changes in focus. To assess whether both imaging arms were correctly co-focussed the knife-edge test was then repeated at $\approx\qty{10}{degrees}$ intervals of the focus adjustment knob for an additional 3 measurements either side of what as initially deemed to be optimal focus. This ensures that what the was assessed to be the optimal focus is where lowest value for spatial resolution is measured.
The results shown in \cref{fig:mtffoci} that in fact the optimal focus was actually located $\approx\qty{10}{degree}$ from what was visually determined to be the best focus. At this minimum the spatial resolution of the sCMOS detector is \qty{50}{\um} and for the FLIMera it is \qty{214}{\um}. At the extremums the spatial resolutions are \qty{296}{\um} and \qty{328}{\um} for the FLIMera, and for sCMOS they are \qty{129}{\um} and \qty{152}{\um}. In the experiments described in later sections of this chapter the focus is set to this new optimal focus with only minor adjustments being made to account for variations in the position of the eye phantom with respect to objective lens of the fundus camera.

\subsection{Comparing Measured Spatial Resolution to Other Retinal Imaging Systems}
While the spatial resolution of both detectors is sufficient to co-register retinal images, the measured spatial resolution of the sCMOS detector significantly deviates from that of a similar system where a COTS fundus camera (Canon CF-60Z) was used to image the same eye phantom. In this case the eye phantom housed capillary tubes filled with blood for the purposes of measuring blood oxygenation in the retina~\cite{mordant2011validation}.
In~\citeauthor{mordant2011validation} the spatial resolution of the system was estimated to be $\approx\qty{30}{\um}$ or $\approx\qty{3}{\pixel}$ by examining line profiles through an image of a \qty{150}{\um} outer-diameter capillary tube and computing the rise time - the number of pixels required to transition from \qty{10}{\percent} to \qty{90}{\percent} of the peak pixel grey-value - within the capillary.

\begin{figure}

In b), the number of pixels to transition from black-to-white or the rise-time, $\tau_{rise}$, is denoted by the solid black lines and was computed as $\tau_{rise} \cong \qty{30}{\um}$. a) Reproduced from Fig. 3A of~\citeauthor{mordant2011validation}\cite{mordant2011validation}.}
    \label{fig:MordauntResolitionFigure}
\end{figure}

The sources of this discrepancy in spatial resolution was thought to originate from the 90:10 beam-splitter in the imaging arm and / or the \qty{500}{\nm} long pass emission filter. A chequerboard target (pitch of \qty{10}{\mm}) was positioned at infinity ($>\qty{3}{\metre}$ from the objective lens of the fundus camera) and these sources were systematically removed from the imaging path. The rise-time or the black-to-white transition time was then be computed for each scenario, as shown \cref{fig:sCMOStroubleshooting}, in terms of pixels and yielded a mean rise-time of \qty{4.5}{\pixel}. Since this difference rise-time ($\qty{3}{\pixel}:\qty{4.5}{\pixel}$) is proportionally similar to the discrepancy in spatial resolution ($\qty{30}{\um}:\qty{50}{\um}$) it was then concluded that the optics of the fundus camera or the SLR lenses used in the imaging arm are the limiting factor and not the beam-splitter or emission filter.

\end{figure}

While efforts could be made to improve the spatial resolution of the SFLIO system to match this achieve this the stated goal of resolving small drusen it was deemed sufficient for quantitative mapping of retinal fluorophores. Further, while the assessment of spatial resolution of the system was treated with a reasonable degree of rigour, the knife-edge test was implemented for its relatively high accuracy when compared to the time and complexity cost. More sensitive characterisations using Siemens Star and US Air force test targets embedded in the eye phantom could have been employed for more robust determinations of the MTF - the results of the knife-edge test were sufficient for this assessment.
Additionally, the irregular pixel aspect ratio and layout of the FLIMera was not accounted for in this analysis. Existing methods using fringe patterns, produced by a Twyman-Green interferometer, projected onto the detector to accurately sample its MTF~\cite{greivenkamp1994modulation} could be used for this. In practice the SFLIO system is optically limited and not detector limited so while these methods would yield more precise and accurate measurements of the MTF and spatial resolution it would not fundamentally change the performance of the systems biochemical resolution nor the requirement for adequate image registration.
