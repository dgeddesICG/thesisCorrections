\section{Motivation and Project Aims}\label{sec:motivation}
The eye is \textbf{the} most metabolically active organ in the body and susceptible to disease that often results in permanent loss of vision if left undiagnosed and untreated. One of the most common retinal diseases, affecting the elderly, Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), affects \qty{20}{\percent} of the population and in a \num{12} month period this disease can progress from the initial symptoms to permanent loss of some central vision~\cite{lim2012age}. Routine and regular retinal imaging is a key tool in the early detection of retinal disease, understanding of disease pathophysiology, and informing effective treatment. Current retinal imaging techniques predominantly diagnose retinal disease by detecting physical damage to the retinal surface - when any loss of vision is permanent. The ability to detect retinal disease at the point of initial biochemical dysfunction - before any physical damage to vision has occurred - would represent a significant paradigm shift in treatments and understanding of the pathophysiology of retinal disease. \\
At the onset of retinal disease the consumption of oxygen and the production of oxygen metabolites across the retina will vary from a healthy eye. While vascular oxygenation has been measured in the retina, this does not reveal any information about how oxygen is being consumed across the retina. \textbf{Further, due to high measurement uncertainties, it is infeasible to distinguish healthy patients from those with advanced Glaucoma using measurements of retinal oxygenation alone. Patients with advanced Glaucoma exhibit \SI{4.4}{\percent} lower venous oxygenation than healthy patients however the uncertainties on these measurements are \SI{+-5.4}{\percent}~\cite{olafsdottir2014retinal}.} However, metabolic health could be indicated by the concentration and distribution of fluorescent biomarkers such as, Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD), which are produced during the consumption of oxygen. This biomarker has been observed in rat cortices\cite{martinez2017understanding} and reproducing this result in fluorescence imaging of the retina could show FAD can be feasibly used to understand metabolic activity in the retina and the progression of retinal disease. Another retinal biomarker, Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) have also been linked with the progression of diabetic retinopathy~\cite{yamagishi2011advanced,milne2013advanced}.\\

\textbf{Fluorescence imaging of the fundus - the area at the back of the eye containing structures such as the retina, macula, optic disc etc. - is widely used, qualitatively, in clinical ophthalmology for resolving markers of AMD progression, drusen, and damage to other retinal structures~\cite{yung2016clinical} but is hindered by several, fundamental, limitations.} 
\textbf{Namely, autofluorescence images of the retina typically exhibit high noise and poor contrast when compared to reflectance images due to: the low intensity threshold for safely exciting retinal fluorophores; and undesirable fluorophores - fluorescent clutter - dominating the feint signal produced by fluorescent metabolic markers.} This dominant fluorescent clutter degrades the ability to quantify the concentration of individual fluorophores and map their distribution across the retina. Even techniques developed to be sensitive to the subtle variations in the fluorescence emission spectra of retinal fluorophores - spectral imaging - are incapable of accurate and precise chemical sensing in the retina.
\\
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is an emergent field of microscopy where the distribution of changes in fluorescence lifetime - the nanosecond-scale time that a fluorophore remains excited for - is used to probe biological structures and their dynamics. FLIM brings unique advantages in that the fluorescence lifetime is intrinsic to each fluorophore but is also invariant to the local concentration or quantum efficiency of the fluorophore. This means that weakly emitting fluorophores of interest can be isolated from complex mixtures if the limitations of low-photon counts or high shot-noise can be overcome. In the retina, endogenous fluorophores exhibit high-overlap of their fluorescence emission spectra and near-identical fluorescence lifetimes which introduces additional challenges.
\\
The techniques of FLIM have recently been adapted for clinical ophthalmology in the field of Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) to explore the diagnostic use that fluorescence lifetimes may offer~\cite{dysli2017fluorescence}. Fluorescence lifetimes are extracted from histograms of arrival times of fluorescence photons to construct a map of fluorescence lifetimes across the retina. The connection between measured fluorescence lifetimes and retinal disease progression was explored by qualitatively comparing lifetime maps of age-matched and gender-matched healthy patients with patients exhibiting a retinal disease such as AMD, Diabetic Retinopathy, and Stargardts disease~\cite{zinkernagel2019fluorescence}. These \textit{in-vivo} studies focus on qualitative comparisons in part due to the relative youth of the field as well as the poor understanding of the specific biochemical imbalances that occur in the retina, and the body, at the onset of retinal disease.
\\
A key deficiency in current retinal imaging techniques is the inability to accurately, and precisely, measure the concentration of fluorescent metabolic markers across the retina - preventing quantitative assessments of retinal metabolic health. Fluorescence lifetime imaging could facilitate a similar quantitative approach to monitoring retinal metabolic health but the efficient use of the available signal will be paramount for ensuring this technology can be feasibly implemented into diagnostic practise.
\\
In this thesis, a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) fundus camera is modified to enable spectrally resolved FLIM measurements of the retina. The use of a COTS fundus camera would allow the technology to be retro-fitted to existing equipment as a lower cost route to adoption in a clinical setting. To enable the concentration of FAD to be measured - a new method of recovering fluorophore concentrations from SFLIM measurements is developed. Using this new instrument and algorithm, the feasibility of measuring retinal FAD concentrations in the retina is assessed by inducing changes in oxygen consumption \textbf{of an anaesthetised} rat and measuring commensurate changes in retinal FAD concentrations.

\section{Morphology \textbf{Of} The Eye and \\Common Retinal Diseases}
In this section, the structures of the eye and their functions will be described before common retinal diseases and their symptoms are discussed. In the final parts of this section the devices used in the routine detection of retinal disease will be described.

\subsection{Morphology of the Eye}
The human eye is a complex organ, capable of forming images with an angular resolving power of around 1 arc-minute with single photon sensitivity~\cite{tinsley2016direct}. Optically, the eye can be thought of as an infinite-conjugate imaging system with a
front illuminated sensor where the cornea and the \textbf{eye's} lens form images - through the retinal vasculature - onto the retina. The structures within the eye can be described as the anterior and posterior \textbf{segments}.

\subsubsection{Anterior Segment}
The cornea protrudes at the front of the eye - making it non-spherical - and is responsible for providing protection for the lens, as well as contributing more than half of the refractive power of the eye. The pigmented iris and pupil form the aperture of the eye and is continuously adjustable from \qtyrange{2}{8}{\mm} in diameter as a response to the intensity of ambient light. The eyes crystalline lens has a diameter of \qtyrange{8}{10}{\mm} and is responsible for fine focusing, and forming - what is perceived by brain as aberration-free - images onto the retina. With both eyes working as a pair a \qty{200}{\degree} Field-Of-View (FOV) can be perceived by the brain.
The eye also contains two humours: the aqueous humour that occupies the volume between the cornea and the lens, and the vitreous humour which fills the volume behind the lens up to the retina. These humours continuously flow through the eye and ensure tissues in the eye are fed with nutrients and maintain the eyes shape.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Posterior Segment}
The retina is a \qty{250}{\micro\metre} thick, photo-sensitive multi-layer slice of tissue located at the rear of the eyeball with blood vessels on the surface supplying it with oxygenated blood. 
\textbf{The top layers of the retina contain the arteries and veins, photoreceptors, the inner nuclear layer and the outer nuclear layer. The arteries and veins supply the tissues of the retina with blood and are fed by the ophthalmic artery. The photoreceptors and inner, and outer nuclear layers are responsible for detecting incident photons and converting them into neuronal activity to be transmitted down the optic nerve, through the optic disk. Around the optic disk the density of photoreceptors varies to make up the different types of vision whereas inside the optic disk there are no photoreceptors.} The macula and fovea contain the highest concentrations of photoreceptors to make up the central vision - $\approx \SI{60}{\degree}$ FOV - with the rest of the retinal surface making up peripheral vision~\cite{bringmann2021fovea}. 
Behind the photoreceptors exists the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) - referred to as the pigment epithelium in~\cref{figintro:eyeanatomy} - which serves as a support structure for the front most layers of the retina as well as choroid and Bruch's membrane which provide blood and nutrients to the RPE and photoreceptors.

\subsection{Common Retinal diseases - \\ Their Indicators and Progression}
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Age-Related Macular Degeneration}\label{subsubsec:intro-amd}
AMD is \textbf{a} progressive disease which results in permanent loss of central vision. Initially, patients present as asymptomatic but in retinal images show the formation of small yellowish deposits in the RPE referred to as ``drusen’’ and progresses as one of two types - ``wet’’ and ``dry’’ AMD. Wet AMD causes abnormal blood vessels to form in the choroid which rupture the RPE and leak blood into the retina, culminating in retinal scarring and permanent vision loss~\cite{abdelsalam1999drusen,bressler2002early}. Dry AMD also progresses towards permanent vision loss where the photoreceptors atrophy – Geographic Atrophy - but with regular screening this type can be treated with intra-retinal injections~\cite{lim2012age,bressler2002early}. Progression of AMD is usually monitored by tracking the change in drusen and any areas of Geographic Atrophy, as shown in~\cref{fig:introAMD}.

Drusen deposits are classified into ``soft’’ and ``hard’’ densities where hard drusen tend to be smaller in size and present a lower risk of vision loss than soft drusen. Soft drusen \textbf{is} hypothesised to be the result of hard drusen breaking down~\cite{sarks1994evolution} and are detected in fluorescence images of the retina~\cite{yung2016clinical}. In~\cref{tab:drusen}, the criteria for characterising the size of drusen are described where small drusen tend to grow into larger drusen.

\subsubsection{Diabetic Retinopathy}\label{subsubsec:intro-dr}
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes affecting nearly all Type 1 diabetic and over \qty{60}{\percent} of Type 2 diabetics within two decades of receiving a diagnosis of diabetes~\cite{fong2004retinopathy}. Chronic high concentrations \textbf{of} glucose in the blood \textbf{– hyperglycaemia -} and large fluctuations in this blood-glucose concentration results in dysfunction in the retinal vasculature. As shown in~\cref{fig:introNPDR}, Blood vessels can swell and cause macular oedemas and micro-aneurysms into the vitreous humour around the macula~\cite{kowluru2007oxidative,mohamed2007management}.

 In the more advanced stages of the disease the lack of sufficient blood flow to the choroid causes new irregular vessels to grow – sometimes through the retina itself~\cite{kowluru2007oxidative}. This latter stage of disease is known as Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR).  Through routine imaging, signs of proliferation in the retinal vasculature and signs of oedemas are monitored with the progression of the disease being classified into PDR, and Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR).

 Treatment of Diabetic retinopathy is normally two-fold: the patient can improve control of blood-glucose concentration and reduce fluctuations and events of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia; and through surgical interventions to reduce the loss of vision due to oedemas. Surgical treatment involves: laser photo coagulation to ablate, and seal, any leaking vessels; and as follow-up any haemorrhaged blood is removed and the missing volume of vitreous humour is made up with saline. These surgeries can slow the effects of PDR (see \cref{figintro:PDR}) but the best intervention is still tight glycaemic control and regular retinal screening with sufficient sensitivity to diabetic retinopathy in its non-proliferative stage~\cite{chan2010resistance}. Tightening glycaemic control – has been shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy by \qty{35}{\percent}~\cite{fong2004retinopathy}.

\subsubsection{Stargardts Disease}\label{subsubsec:intro-stargardt}
Stargardts Disease is a heritable form of macular degeneration caused by a mutation of the ABCA4 gene on chromosome 1. Affecting around 1 in \numrange{8000}{10000}~\cite{tanna2017stargardt,monica1999analysis,tsang2018stargardt}, retinal images show the formation, and build-up of yellowish flecks in the RPE, centred on the fovea, and presenting as hypo-fluorescent regions in autofluorescence images. These characteristic ``flecks’’ are similar in appearance to drusen but over time cause dysfunction in the RPE leading to irrecoverable loss of central vision~\cite{mcbain2012progression}.

Adapted from Figures 27.1 and 27.2 of~\citeauthor{tsang2018stargardt}~\cite{tsang2018stargardt}.}
    \label{fig:stargardts}
\end{figure}
Currently there are no documented treatments for slowing the progression of the disease or literature on the process by which the clusters of flecks form and grow~\cite{huang2022stargardt}.  Stargardts Disease is diagnosed by the presence of ``flecks'' in fundus autofluorescence images. The development of an imaging technique that can detect the formation of this earlier in its progression could be vital for researching the pathophysiology of the disease and informing treatments.

\subsection{Current Retinal Imaging Devices \\ and Modalities}
\subsubsection{Fundus Camera}
The most common device for routine assessments of retinal health is the fundus camera. The Fundus camera records images by flood illuminating, and imaging, the retina over a FOV of \qtyrange{50}{80}{\degree}. \textbf{Annular illumination is used to improve image quality by separating illumination and imaging light to reduce the contamination in the retinal image by directly reflected light - this known as the Gullstrand principle~\cite{gullstrand1910neue}}. The key advantage of the fundus camera is the variety of imaging modalities. \textbf{While brightfield imaging and autofluorescence imaging are the most prevalent imaging modalities in clinical ophthalmology - techniques such as Fluorescein Angiography (FA) and Indo-Cyanine Green imaging are often used for monitoring blood flow in the retina}. FA and ICG involve intravenously injecting the patient with fluorescent dye which then circulates throughout the retinal vasculature thus revealing areas of the retina with low-circulation and at risk of damage~\cite{stanga2003indocyanine,bennett2001fundamentals,spaide2015retinal}.  Despite being a flexible imaging platform fundus cameras are limited by the FOV they can image – covering only \qty{15}{\percent} of the retina – which can lead to conditions such as peripheral retinal detachments being undiagnosed until loss of central vision occurs.
\subsubsection{Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy}
Instead of flood illuminating the retina and recording an image with an array-detector, the Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) raster scans a laser source across the retina and records fluctuations in reflected intensity with a single-pixel detector (PMT) \cite{webb1980flying}. Optos SLO systems use a pair of elliptical mirrors to increase the angle of the laser illumination through the pupil to achieve illumination over a \qty{220}{\degree} FOV or \qty{82}{\percent} of the retina without the need to dilate the pupil~\cite{ashraf2022comparison,keane2014retinal}. \textbf{By not requiring the pupil to be dilated not only is patient comfort improved but a common side-effect of the dilation agent, called close-angle Glaucoma, is negated~\cite{yang2019drug}}. Confocal imaging using an aperture fitted to the detection path, conjugate to the retina, can be used to increase contrast in retinal images and allow some optical sectioning~\cite{webb1980flying}. SLO systems do come with the drawback of being significantly more expensive than fundus cameras. This limits adoption and motivates the need for a low-cost imaging device with an equivalent ability for earlier diagnosis of retina disease.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Optical Coherence Tomography}
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) leverages the principles of Michelson Interferometry to allow axial imaging of the retina. In OCT, reflected light from the retina is interfered with the illumination beam and the resultant intensity pattern is recorded. The path length of the illumination beam can then be tuned thus interfering with deeper layers of the retina – forming a depth profile of a single point with sub-micron layer resolution as shown in~\cref{fig:octfig}. Typically, the beam is scanned across the retina to build up line scanned images through features of interest~\cite{huang1991optical,podoleanu2012optical}. OCT is most effective for studying structural changes in the retina such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration~\cite{yehoshua2011natural}

\section{Concepts of Fluorescence and \\ Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging}
In this section basic concepts of fluorescence, and the fluorescence lifetime, will be described and techniques in the field of Fluorescence lifetime imaging will be discussed.
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Mechanics of Fluorescence Lifetimes}
Fluorescence is a radiative process where photons are emitted from a substance due to the excitation and subsequent relaxation of electronic singlet states. This process is commonly visualised using a Jablonski diagram in~\cref{figintro:jablonski}.
\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/introduction/JablonskiDiagram.pdf}
    \caption{Jablonski diagram of the mechanics behind fluorescence. $S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}$, denoted by bold lines, represent the ground and the first two excited singlet states. Non-radiative processes such as internal conversion between vibrational states (grey dashed) and inter-system crossing (purple) allow for the emission of a fluorescence photon ($S_{1}\rightarrow S_{0}$, shown in green, or a phosphorescence photon ($ S_{1}\rightarrow T_{1}\rightarrow S_{0} $), shown in red}
    \label{figintro:jablonski}
\end{figure}
Absorption of photons promote an electron from the ground electronic singlet state $S_{0}$, to a vibrational state within a higher electronic state, $S_{1}, S_{2}$,\ldots, $S_{n}$. Non-radiative internal conversion relax the electron in the fluorophore back into the $S_{1}$ state. The electron can then decay back into the $S_{0}$ state by emitting a fluorescence photon or undergo an inter-system crossing to the first triplet-state, $T_{1}$, and then decay to the ground state to produce a phosphorescence photon. 
These radiative and non-radiative processes occur over different time scales: absorption occurs over \qty{e-15}{\second}; internal conversions and inter-system crossings occur \qty{e-12}{\second}; phosphorescence decays take place over time-scales of \qtyrange{e-7}{e-3}{\second}~\cite{lakowicz2013fluorescencespectroscopybook}. Of key interest in this thesis is the decay times due to fluorescence which occur over a few nanoseconds~\cite{lakowicz2013fluorescencespectroscopybook}.
\textbf{The process of fluorescence is random i.e. within a single unit-area the excited electronic state of the fluorescence molecule is not depopulated in a single instant. Instead, the population of $S_{1}$ decays to $S_{0}$ at a constant rate - where the inverse of this decay rate is the fluorescence lifetime. External, non-radiative processes, such as quenching, can affect this decay rate resulting in a measured fluorescence lifetime that differs from the fluorophore's intrinsic lifetime.} The time-dependent intensity of fluorescence can then be modelled from the rate-of-change of concentration of fluorophores in the excited state $S_{1}$ is [$S_{1}$]:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt}[S_{1}] = -\Gamma [S_{1}]\,,
    \label{eqintro:conc}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is the rate at which fluorescence photons are produced and is the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime ($\Gamma = \nicefrac{1}{\tau}$). By then associating the measured time-evolved intensity with the concentration, $[S_{1}]$, the fluorescence decay can be modelled:
\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dt}I(t) &= -\Gamma I(t)\\
    \implies I(t) &= I_{0}\exp(-\nicefrac{t}{\tau})\,.
    \label{eqintro:lifetime}
\end{align}
For mixtures of fluorophores, and fluorophores with unique molecular properties, multi-exponential decays with $N$ fluorescence lifetimes are described using:
\begin{equation}
    I(t) = I_{0}\sum_{n>0}^{N}\alpha_{n}\exp(-\nicefrac{t}{\tau_{n}})
    \label{eqintro:multiexp}
\end{equation}
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Stokes Shifts and Spectral Emission Characteristics}
The vibrational states of $S_{1}$ reachable through absorption of an excitation photon and the subsequent relaxation into the different vibrational states of $S_{0}$ incurs a small energy loss and results in a phenomenon called the ``Stokes Shift'' where the emitted fluorescence photon is always of a longer wavelength than the excitation photon. When measuring the comparatively weak fluorescence signal the Stoke's Shift means that any reflected light originating from the excitation source can be filtered out. \textbf{Typically, this Stokes shift is on the order of \qtyrange{10}{100}{\nm} where for example FAD has a Stokes shift of around \SI{75}{\nm}~\cite{schweitzer2007towards} and for a common fluorescence dye like fluorescein, this Stokes shift is on the order of \SI{20}{\nm}~\cite{zhang2014fluorescence}.}
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Detection Schemes for FLIM}
Before a fluorescence lifetime can be recovered first the time resolved decay must be recorded. Typically one of two methods are used for \textbf{Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) }: ``Time Domain'' or ``Frequency Domain''. Each method has its benefits and unique methods for recovering the fluorescence lifetime. Before the advent of SPAD arrays, the excitation source would be scanned across the sample and fluorescence decays would be recorded using a Photo-Multiplier Tube (PMT) with single-photon counting capabilities. \textbf{Improvements} in new generation SPAD arrays, and gated sCMOS detectors, are quickly making widefield FLIM a more feasible and attractive method for FLIM imaging.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Time-Domain FLIM}
Time-Domain FLIM techniques predominantly use a pulsed laser source, with pulse-width $\approx\qty{100}{\ps}$ and repetition rates of $\approx \qtyrange{50}{100}{\mega\hertz}$, to excite fluorescence and then over a series of pulses, sample the fluorescence as it decays over time. The fluorescence lifetime can be then extracted using one of many techniques. \\
In this section, the two popular techniques of Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting and Time-Gated FLIM are described.
\paragraph*{Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting FLIM\\}\label{par:tcspcflim}
In Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC) FLIM, fluorescence is excited with a short, typically $<\qty{100}{\ps}$, laser pulse, and the arrival time of the first photon incident on the detector is measured. Since fluorescence is a random process, the entire fluorescence decay can be recorded - with precision of \qtyrange{5}{50}{\ps} - by building a histogram of photon arrival times over the course of multiple laser pulses. In wide-field FLIM, typically these detectors take the form of an array of Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) with separate, on-pixel, electronics for correlating the photon arrival times with their respective laser pulses - Time-Correlated \textbf{Single} Photon Counting (TCSPC). TCSPC-SPADs have two methods for correlating arriving photons to their laser pulse: forward-counting and backward-counting mode. In forward-counting mode, as shown in~\cref{introfig:tcspc}, the laser signals that \textbf{a} pulse has been emitted, and the time interval between this signal and the first detected photon is used as the photon arrival time. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/introduction/TCSPCDiagram.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram demonstrating the principle of Time Correlated Single Photon Counting in forward-counting mode. The photon arrival time is recorded by starting a timer when a laser pulse is emitted and is stopped when the first photon is detected. Any subsequent photon\textbf{s} incident on the detector during its dwell time are not recorded.}
    \label{introfig:tcspc}
\end{figure}
Conversely, backward-counting schemes are often preferred in photon starved regimes, and where the dwell time between recording a photon arrival and resetting the timing electronics is longer than a laser period. Now the time interval between a photon being detected and the next signalled laser pulse is used as the photon arrival time - decreasing the number of refractory periods where photons are not detected and allowing histograms to be built over a shorter integration time. 
\\
Additionally, the nature of TCSPC leads to a behaviour of ``photon pile-up'' where the fluorescence decay histograms are biased towards early arrival times due to laser pulses causing multiple photons to be excited and impinge on the detector within a single laser period. Since only the first photon can be counted the rest are discarded and early arriving photons will be over-represented in the histogram. The intensity of the laser source should then be attenuated to prevent this ``photon pile-up''.
\\
The fluorescence lifetime can then be recovered using: non-linear least-squares fitting techniques, statistical techniques, or Fourier based techniques - all of which have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. These techniques are discussed in more detail in~\cref{sec:intro-lifetimemethods}.
\paragraph*{Time Gated FLIM\\}\label{sec:intro-gatedFLIM}
For Time-Gated FLIM detection schemes, the sample to be imaged is \textbf{excited} using a laser source with a short pulse width and high repetition rate but the fluorescence decay is sampled using 2 or more exposure windows of equal width, $\approx\qtyrange{1}{2}{\ns}$, over multiple laser pulses (see \cref{subfigintro:tgflim}). \textbf{To achieve this, typically} a gated camera is synchronised to the laser source and multiple images are recorded with exposures $\approx\qtyrange{1}{2}{\ns}$ where the delay to the first image and between images, and the number of images, are customised for each imaging scenario. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.47\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{figures/introduction/TimeGatedFlim.pdf}
        \caption{}

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.47\textwidth}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{\textbf{Detection schemes used for resolving single exponential (\subref{subfigintro:tgflim})  and bi-exponential (\subref{subfigintro:tgflimbi}) using the Time Gated FLIM method. Each acquisition window, $N_{n}$, has equal integration time, $\Delta t$ and is synchronised to the laser pulse that excites fluorescence.}}
    \label{figintro:tgflim}
\end{figure}
For mono-exponential decays, the fluorescence lifetime, $\tau$, is then recovered using the ratio of the number of photons detected in each image and the length of exposure for each image:
\begin{equation}\label{eqintro:rld}
    \tau = \frac{\Delta t}{\ln(N_{1}/N_{2})}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the width of the gates, and $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ are the number of photons detected in each image. For fluorophores exhibiting a bi-exponential decay both fluorescence lifetimes can still be resolved albeit now 4 gated images are required (\cref{subfigintro:tgflimbi}). For contiguous gates this means each gate is narrower in the time domain - fewer photons are detected - and each image exhibiting higher noise. Using wider, overlapping, gates reduces the noise in each gated image at the cost of longer image acquisition times since multiple gated images cannot be recorded per laser pulse. The model for recovering both lifetime components, $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$, and relative concentrations, $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$, becomes verbose and for brevity is not described here but can be found in Eq.~16-25 of~\citeauthor{sharman1999error} where it is defined for both contiguous and overlapping gates~\cite{sharman1999error}.
\\
The key attractions of Time-Gated FLIM lie in its capability for fast and efficient recording and determination of fluorescence lifetimes - with video-rate Wide-field FLIM being reported~\cite{elson2004real,ulku2020wide}. This does come at the expense of being limited to resolving fewer than 2 fluorescence lifetimes with reduced accuracy when compared to SPAD-TCSPC detection schemes~\cite{ballew1989error}. For this thesis it was deemed this decreased lifetime resolution rendered it unsuitable for attempting to discriminate, and quantify, retinal fluorophore concentrations.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Frequency Domain FLIM}\label{sec:intro-fdFLIM}
Fluorescence lifetime imaging can also be achieved in the frequency domain. Commonly the intensity of the excitation source is periodically modulated. Frequency domain FLIM measurements can also be recorded by periodically modulating the gain of an image intensifier in a CCD detector~\cite{verveer2009frequency}. Shown in \cref{figintro:fdflim}, there is a change in amplitude and the phase shift of the recorded fluorescence signal - when compared with the excitation waveform - and is dependent on the quantum efficiency of the fluorophore as well as its fluorescence lifetime~\cite{lakowicz1991lifetime, verveer2009frequency}. Frequency domain FLIM has been demonstrated in both point-scanning based systems with a single PMT~\cite{serafino2023direct} and in widefield imaging using a gated-intensifier camera which records images across multiple phase intervals~\cite{chen2013practical}. To avoid errors in recovering fluorescence lifetimes for widefield imaging due to aliasing, the phase intervals, corresponding to a sampling frequency, $\omega_{s}$, must be chosen such that the laser modulation, $\omega_{l}$, is sampled by the \textbf{detector below the Nyquist limit such that $w_{l} < 2\omega_{s}$}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{figures/introduction/FDflim.pdf}
    \caption{Example of principle of Frequency-Domain FLIM. A continuous wave source (black line) is intensity modulated with a frequency, $\omega = \SI{80}{\mega\hertz}$. A fluorophore with lifetime, $\tau = \SI{5}{\nano\second}$, causes a lifetime dependent phase, $\phi$, and amplitude, $M$, modulation in the recorded fluorescence intensity.}
    \label{figintro:fdflim}
\end{figure}
\paragraph*{Recovering Lifetimes in Frequency-Domain FLIM}
The fluorescence lifetime, $\tau$, can then be recovered from the measured phase-shift, $\phi$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqintro:fdlifetime}
    \tau = \frac{1}{\omega}\tan(\phi)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the laser modulation frequency expressed in units of \unit{\radian\per\second}\textbf{.}
Or from the relative change in the amplitude in the recorded fluorescence signal, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqintro:fdmodulation}
    M = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \omega^{2}\tau^{2}}}\,,
\end{equation}
where the modulation, $M$, is equivalent to the ratio, $\nicefrac{m_{F}}{m_L}$, of the amplitude of the recorded fluorescence signal, $m_{F}$, and the amplitude of the laser modulation signal, $m_{L}$.
\\
Lifetime components from mixtures of fluorophores can also be recovered by using multiple modulation frequencies where typically for $n$-lifetimes a signal with $n$-harmonics of a sinusoid with frequency, \textbf{$nw$,} are required. In the limit, a signal composed of only the odd-ordered harmonics now approaches a square-wave modulation although now the fluorescence signal must be Nyquist sampled at $w_{l} < 2n\omega_{s}$.~\citeauthor{squire2000multiple} demonstrated this square-wave modulation in a frequency-domain FLIM experiment where structures inside HeLa cells were stained\textbf{ with }green fluorescence-protein staining the Golgi, an organelle responsible for distributing proteins outwith the cell, and yellow fluorescent-protein staining the cells nucleus. Despite these structures physically overlapping each other - Golgi surround the nuclei - both stains were successfully unmixed with images of fluorophore concentration and lifetime being commensurate with what was present in literature~\cite{squire2000multiple}.

\section{Fluorescence Lifetime Recovery Methods}\label{sec:intro-lifetimemethods}
In this project a TCSPC-SPAD array is used, the Horiba FLIMera, and is described in more detail in~\cref{subsec:flimeradetails}. For this detection scheme, there are various methods of recovering fluorescence lifetimes from the histograms of photon arrival times - each with their own unique capabilities and drawbacks. Mainly, these techniques can be broken down into fitting-based techniques, and purported ``fit-free'' techniques. Fitting based techniques tend to be computationally intensive but more accurate whereas ``fit-free'' techniques tend to trade-off accuracy in recovering lifetimes for a lowered computational burden or unique methods of visualising the distribution of fluorescence lifetimes across the sample. This section will cover the four most common FLIM analysis techniques although it should be noted \textbf{that} recovering the fluorescence lifetime was not extensively used in favour of the bespoke SFLIM unmixing technique developed in~\cref{chap:tensSFLIM}.
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Least-Squares Fitting Based Techniques}\label{subsec:intro-lsqfitting}
Fitting based techniques will typically use an iterative approach where the difference between a chosen fitting model typically a mono-exponential or \textbf{multi}-exponential decay,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:multiexp}
    I(t) = A\sum_{n=0}^{N}a_{n}\exp\bigg(\frac{-(t-t_{0})}{\tau_{n}}\bigg) + c\,,
\end{equation}
and the measured histogram is then minimised.
Most popular least-squares fitting routines use the Levenberg-Marquadt Algorithm where the parameter space - in this case $\{A,c,\tau_{n}, a_{n}\}\rvert_{n=0}^{N}$, is iteratively traversed in the direction which approaches a global-minima the fastest given a initial estimate of the fitting parameters. The number of exponentials chosen for the fitting model is normally informed by some prior knowledge of the number of fluorophores in the sample and their reported lifetimes but \textbf{often low SNR in histograms requires the number of exponential terms to be reduced. This does bias the recovered lifetimes however is commonly used in research for qualitative comparisons of lifetimes over a single sample or between biological events to be probed.}
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{The Instrument Response Function}
Within the histograms recorded using TCPSC-FLIM, the fluorescence decay is contaminated by the non-zero width of the pulse from the excitation source, dispersion from optics in the imaging system, and the temporal response of the SPAD-TCSPC array itself. This temporal response is known as the Instrument Response Function (IRF):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:irf}
    I(t) = IRF(t) \circledast  A\sum_{n=0}^{N}a_{n}\exp\bigg(\frac{-(t-t_{0})}{\tau_{n}}\bigg) +c 
\end{equation}
The measured histogram is then represented as a convolution of the IRF with the multi-exponential decay model with the effect of biasing the recovered fluorescence lifetimes~\cite{trinh2021biochemical}.
The IRF can be characterised by measuring backscattered light through the system by placing a silver mirror at the sample plane. Other methods involve imaging a fluorophore with fluorescence lifetimes shorter than a single time-bin - meaning the second term in the convolution approximates a Dirac-Delta function~\cite{margineanu2025calibration}. Rigorous characterisation of the IRF is not required for the tail-fitting method to be discussed next - however some indication of the approximate width of the IRF is beneficial.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Tail-Fitting}\label{subsubsec:tailfitting}
The tail-fitting approach to recovering fluorescence lifetimes avoids the need to rigorously characterise the IRF of the FLIM imaging system by adjusting the window over which the histogram is fitted. \textbf{The fitting window is initially chosen to start when IRF decreases to near 0, and end when the SNR of the histogram approaches 1.} The fitting window, and multi-exponential model is then tuned until the $\chi^{2}$, or goodness-of-fit - is satisfactory. In histograms with low numbers of photons, small adjustments of this fitting window can introduce significant changes in the fitted lifetime - biasing the fit towards lifetimes that are in good agreement with the decay within the fitting window rather than the histogram as a whole. 
\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/introduction/tailfittingfigure.pdf}
    \caption{Tail-fitting can be used to recover fluorescence lifetimes from TCSPC histograms without prior knowledge of the IRF. A chosen multi-exponential decay is fitted within a window (region bounded by the vertical orange lines).

Tail-fitting yielded a recovered lifetime of \qty{2.1}{\ns}}
    \label{fig:introtailfit}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Re-convolution Based Fitting}\label{subsubsec:reconv}
If the IRF of the FLIM has been sufficiently characterised, then re-convolution based fitting can be used to more accurately determine fluorescence lifetimes. For this approach the fitting model is modified from the multi-exponential decay in~\cref{eqintro:multiexp} to the model in~\cref{eq:irf} which now includes the convolution of the IRF with the decay function. From the simulations shown in \cref{fig:introreconv} and \cref{fig:introtailfit}, this type of fitting allows less deviation from the ground-truth when recovering fluorescence lifetimes, given sufficient photon counts.
\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/introduction/reconvfittingfigure.pdf}
    \caption{Reconvolution fitting incorporates the IRF by convolving the IRF (green line) with the chosen fitting model and minimising the differences between this convolution and the TCSPC histogram (grey line) to produce a line of best fit (red line). With 1000 photons, a lifetime of \qty{2.2}{\ns} is recovered from a simulated decay with lifetime of \qty{2.4}{\ns} and convolved with a Gaussian IRF with FWHM of \qty{750}{\ps}. Reconvolution fitting was performed using the \textit{FLIMlib} python package - the same fitting engine as the popular FLIMJ ImageJ plug-in~\cite{gao2020flimj}}
    \label{fig:introreconv}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Rapid-Lifetime Determination}\label{subsec:intro-rapidlifetime}
\textbf{The fitting based techniques described in~\cref{subsubsec:tailfitting} and~\cref{subsubsec:reconv}, are computationally intensive, requiring $>\qty{5}{\minute}$ to fit a lifetime model to each histogram in a $\approx50,000$ pixel FLIM image. In the case of reconvolution-based fitting an additional measurement of the IRF is required.} To address this, Rapid-Lifetime Determination (RLD) methods were developed predominately for time-gated FLIM detection schemes but are equally applicable to TCPSC based FLIM. Lifetimes are recovered in exactly the same way as described \textbf{in the TCSPC-FLIM paragraph of}~\cref{sec:intro-gatedFLIM} but now the two time-gated images are formed by summing together multiple time-bins of a fluorescence histogram.
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Phasor Analysis}\label{subsec:intro-phasor}
Phasor analysis is a computationally cheap, Fourier-based, method for recovering fluorescence lifetimes from histograms recorded with a TSCPC Time-Domain FLIM detection scheme. Computationally, the phasor transform can be implemented using a Fast-Fourier Transform for real-time determination of lifetimes~\cite{levitt2020quantitative,sorrells2021real}. The phasor transform maps each area-normalised histogram, $I(t)$, to a point in phasor-space, $(g,s)$,
\begin{align}{\label{eq:intro-phasortransform}}
    g &= \int_{0}^{T}I(t)\cos(2\pi ft)dt = real(\mathcal{F}\{I(t)\}\rvert_{n=1})\\
    s &= \int_{0}^{T}I(t)\sin(2\pi ft)dt = imag(\mathcal{F}\{I(t)\}\rvert_{n=1})
\end{align}
where $f$ refers to the repetition rate of the pulsed excitation source when $t$ is in units of time. 
For mono-exponential decay lifetime,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro-phasorlifetime}
    \tau = \frac{1}{2\pi f}\bigg(\frac{s}{g}\bigg)\,,
\end{equation}
can then be recovered from these phasor coordinates, $s$ and $g$.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Lifetime Segmentation in Phasor FLIM}
A key convenience of the phasor transform is the ability to easily segment images by exploiting the fact that fluorophores with distinct lifetimes will occupy distinct areas in phasor-space. As shown in~\cref{fig:phasorbiunmix}, fluorophores expressing a single lifetime will occupy a point along the semi-circle with diameter of 1, and centred on $g=0.5, s=0$. Fluorophores exhibiting $N$-lifetimes will occupy points within an $N$-polygon where the vertices, lying on this semi-circle, represent the $N$-lifetime component. The relative concentration of each component can then be found using a process akin to Vertex Components Analysis - an analysis technique used frequently in remote sensing and spectral imaging~\cite{nascimento2005vertex,dean2014fast}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{figures/sflim/phasor-unmixing/PhasorUnmix.pdf}
    \caption{Depiction of unmixing a combination fluorophores using phasor analysis. For this mixture of 2 fluorophores the pure endmembers are represented as single exponential decays (black circle and green star) and thus have phasors lying on the unit circle. A third phasor consisting of a mixture of two fluorophores, with relative abundances $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$, lies upon a line intersecting both endmember phasors. The relative abundances are recovered using the fractional lengths $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ : $\alpha_{1} = \frac{f_{1}}{f_{1} + f_{2}}$, $\alpha_{2} = \frac{f_{2}}{f_{1} + f_{2}}$ }
    \label{fig:phasorbiunmix}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Compensating for the IRF in Phasor FLIM}
The IRF of the FLIM imaging system can be accounted for in phasor analysis quite simply by expressing the phasor-coordinates, $(g,s)$ of a TCSPC histogram, and the IRF, in polar-form $(m = \sqrt{g^{2} + s^{2}}, \varphi = \arctan({\nicefrac{s}{g}}) )$. In phasor-space the IRF has the effect of applying a rotation, around the origin, and stretching of a phasor representing a pure mono-exponential decay $(m_{DECAY}, \varphi_{DECAY})$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:intro-phasorirf}
    m_{DECAY} &= \frac{m_{TCSPC}}{m_{IRF}}\\
    \varphi_{DECAY} &= \varphi_{TCSPC} - \varphi_{IRF}
\end{align}
where now the IRF, ($m_{IRF}, \varphi_{IRF}$), can be compensated for in a measurement \\ $(m_{TCSPC}, \varphi_{TCSPC})$ to yield the phasor representing the fluorescence decay.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Phasor Analysis Beyond FLIM}\label{subsubsec:into-phasorbeyond}
Phasor analysis has also seen usage beyond standard FLIM imaging. For spectrally-resolved FLIM measurements it has been adapted for unmixing of mixtures of fluorophores - to be explored in \cref{sec:phasor-sflim} - for samples with stained structures. In Fluorescence microscopy, phasor analysis has also seen use as a computational analysis technique for fluorescence spectroscopy~\cite{fereidouni2012spectral} and implemented as an optical analysis technique~\cite{wang2023single,hedde2021phasor}. For the latter case, a beamsplitter and pair of fluorescence emission filters with spectral transmission functions resembling a sine and cosine wave to enable images of the $s$, and $g$ phasor-coordinates to be directly recorded. Finally, it should be highlighted that phasor analysis was previously, and still is, a common technique for analysing AC electronic circuits and signals~\cite{semmlow2005circuits}.

\section{FLIO - Fluorescence Lifetime \\ Imaging Ophthalmoscopy}
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) has emerged in the past 20 years with the goal of exploiting the heightened ability of FLIM to discriminate fluorophores. the presence or changes in fluorescent biomarkers could be used to signal the presence of retinal disease or be a useful marker of disease progression. The following section describes this FLIO imaging device and summarises current efforts in establishing links between the indicators of retinal disease and the distribution of fluorescence lifetimes in the retina.
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Description of the Heidelberg - Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Ophthalmoscope}
In most of the literature in FLIO, a single class of device is used and is based on a modified commercial SLO~\cite{dysli2017fluorescence,dysli2014quantitative,dysli2017AMDfluorescence,sauer2018patterns,dysli2016autofluorescence,schmidt2017fundus, dysli2016Stargardtfluorescence,solberg2019retinal}. The Heidelberg Spectralis is a confocal SLO with additional capabilities of performing OCT imaging and has been modified to allow for fluorescence lifetime imaging over two spectral bands. Fluorescence is excited by a \qty{200}{\pico\watt} laser source (\qty{86}{\ps} at \qty{80}{\mega\hertz} repetition rate) at a wavelength of \qty{460}{\nm} and the fluorescence is split into a short wavelength channel (\qtyrange{500}{560}{\nm}) and a long wavelength channel (\qty{560}{\nm}\textbf{ long pass filter}) using a pair of PMTs with TCSPC electronics to record photon arrival times. These two spectral channels were influenced by~\citeauthor{schweitzer2007towards} to more effectively discriminate fluorescence from the fluorophores AGE, and FAD, from lipofuscin~\cite{schweitzer2007towards}. Lipofuscin is the dominant source of fluorescence in wavelengths above \qty{560}{\nm} and is thus the dominant fluorescence lifetime present in the long wavelength channel.
With the Heidelberg FLIO system, a~\numproduct{256 x 256} pixel fluorescence-lifetime image is recorded of the retina over an FOV of \qty{30}{\degree} \textbf{with} an acquisition window of \qty{60}{\second}. Due to the long integration time required to collect a sufficient number of photons in FLIO imaging, the comparatively faster, natural movements of the eye (\qtyrange{25}{1000}{\ms} – see~\cref{sec:motionreg}) would degrade the image and introduce motion artefacts and blurring. This motion is then compensated for using blood vessels in IR images of the retina recorded, at video-rate, with an additional IR source and PMT detector.
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Connections between Retinal Disease and Fluorescence Lifetime}
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Fluorescence Lifetimes in AMD}
AMD presents as an attractive candidate to study using the FLIO technique given that is one of the most prevalent retinal diseases and outcomes from treatment improve greatly when detected early enough~\cite{clemons2005risk}.~\citeauthor{dysli2017AMDfluorescence} used FLIO to assess whether there are any discernible correlations between fluorescence lifetimes and the progression of AMD. Of a cohort of 64 patients, they found that drusen displayed longer fluorescence lifetimes than the surrounding tissues, and that in general the lifetimes of retinas showing signs of AMD are longer than age and sex matched healthy retinas \cite{dysli2017AMDfluorescence}. Further, \citeauthor{sauer2018patterns} found that in ``dry’’ AMD patients presented with a ring of shorter lifetimes (see \cref{fig:flioamd}) in the long-spectral channel $>\qty{560}{\nm}$ around the macula although \qty{36}{\percent} \textbf{of} imaged patients without AMD also displayed this characteristic ring~\cite{sauer2018patterns}. In both publications the authors posited that since this change \textbf{in} fluorescence is only seen in the long-spectral channel then it could be due to changes in lipofuscin distribution, or the accumulation of bisretinoids in the RPE~\cite{sauer2018patterns}. A shortcoming of these publications is that individual drusen could not be distinguished using FLIO alone where OCT imaging was required to confirm the presence of drusen.
\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/introduction/AMDFLIOFigure.pdf}
    \caption{Fundus autofluorescence, and fluorescence lifetime images recorded of patients that are healthy, with non-exudative AMD, and advanced Geographic Atrophy. Images of retinas with AMD, and GA both show rings of increased fluorescence lifetimes compared to the surrounding tissue - \qty{500}{\ps} in the affected area, and \qty{300}{\ps} in the surrounding retinal tissue. Figure adapted from Figure 1 and 6 of \citeauthor{sauer2018patterns}\cite{sauer2018patterns}}
    \label{fig:flioamd}
\end{figure}
Areas of geographic atrophy in the advanced stage of dry AMD show increased fluorescence lifetimes when compared to surrounding retinal tissue and as shown in~\cref{fig:flioamd}, these areas of longer lifetimes form unique patterns dependent on the nature of the macular atrophy~\cite{dysli2016autofluorescence}.~\citeauthor{dysli2016autofluorescence} reported that in the short spectral channel, lifetimes are \qty{152}{\percent} longer, and in the long spectral channel, the increase is \qty{83}{\percent} over a cohort of 41 patients with varying forms of advanced AMD~\cite{dysli2016autofluorescence}. While this is a promising result for FLIO\textbf{,} this stage of disease progression still presents with permanent vision loss.

\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Fluorescence Lifetimes in Diabetic Retinopathy}
In diabetic retinopathy the ability to detect abnormalities in the retinal vasculature before visual symptoms occur is critical for preventing permanent vision loss. The progression of diabetic retinopathy has been linked to the accumulation of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE) – a dominant fluorophore found in the retina and lens~\cite{schweitzer2007towards}. Discriminating AGEs from standard fundus autofluorescence images is prohibitively difficult due to high overlap of fluorescence emission spectra of retinal fluorophores. Quantification of AGEs using FLIO would enable diabetic retinopathy to be diagnosed earlier in its progression allowing for more effective treatments. \textbf{Both~\citeauthor{schweitzer2015fluorescence} and \citeauthor{schmidt2017fundus} showed that type 2 diabetics exhibit increased retinal fluorescence lifetimes compared to healthy volunteers even if they did not present with symptoms of diabetic retinopathy~\cite{schweitzer2015fluorescence,schmidt2017fundus}.} They suggested that repeated events of hyperglycaemia would lead to AGEs accumulating in the lens and the neuronal layer of the retina. Later,~\citeauthor{schmidt2017fundus} showed that fluorescence lifetimes in the lens - recorded by adjusting the focal plane of the FLIO device onto the eye’s lens~\cite{schmidt2017fundus} - can be used to discriminate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy from healthy volunteers with high sensitivity of \qty{90.9}{\percent}, and specificity of \qty{71.4}{\percent}.
\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Fluorescence Lifetimes in Stargardts Disease}
Despite there being no effective treatments for Stargardts disease, FLIO could be a useful technique for diagnosing and tracking progression from the initial biochemical dysfunction stages of the disease. The characteristic flecks associated with Stargardts Disease appear in fluorescence lifetime images of the retina as fleck shaped regions with lifetimes shorter and longer than the surrounding retinal tissue. In autofluorescence images these short-lifetime flecks are absent and ~\citeauthor{dysli2016Stargardtfluorescence} theorised that these short lifetime flecks might progress into long-lifetime flecks~\cite{dysli2016Stargardtfluorescence}. 
\begin{figure}[htp]

    \caption{After a 44-month follow-up, the characteristic flecks of Stargardt Disease show lengthened fluorescence lifetimes in the centre of the fleck that radiate outward (1) and (2). These flecks also show progression in both fundus autofluorescence and OCT images. Figure reproduced from Fig.~4 of~\citeauthor{solberg2019retinal}\cite{solberg2019retinal}.}
    \label{fig:fliostargardt}

A longitudinal study on patients with Stargardts Disease revealed that in early stages of the disease short-lifetime flecks appear approximately twice as often as long-lifetimes flecks in the early stages of disease. Follow-up images of fluorescence lifetimes showed that in \qty{75}{\percent} of cases that short-lifetime flecks – that would not normally be visible in autofluorescence images – transitioned to long-lifetime flecks~\cite{solberg2019retinal}.~\cref{fig:fliostargardt} shows the progression of short to long-lifetimes begins with the long-lifetimes forming in the centre of the fleck and then radiating outwards.
From these two publications, FLIO appears to be a good candidate for longitudinal study of Stargardts to further understand its progression, pathophysiology, and to develop effective treatments.

\subsection{Limitations of Qualitative Assessment for Understanding Disease Pathophysiology}
While FLIO is still a young field, there is a lack of quantitative analyses on fluorophore concentrations. In the bulk of the literature, the connection between disease and fluorescence lifetimes are spoken of in terms of relative changes in lifetime when compared with either healthy retinas or the surrounding retinal tissue. In some of the published works there are hypotheses offered for why fluorescence lifetimes change~\cite{solberg2019retinal,dysli2017AMDfluorescence,schmidt2017fundus} but these works also focus on qualitative differences in fluorescence lifetimes in the retina. Quantitative measurements of the concentration, and distribution, of retinal fluorophores would enable deeper understanding of the biochemical changes that occur in the retina during the formation and progression of retinal disease. The use of lifetime fitting would not be the most effective method of quantifying fluorophore concentrations. Mixtures of common retinal fluorophores would exhibit fluorescence decay models requiring at least $>\numrange{1e6}{1e7}$ photons (see~\cref{sec:lifeunmix}) motivating the need for a new method of unmixing fluorescent endmembers from their fluorescence decay profile.

\section{Methods of Measuring Metabolic Function \\ in the Retina}\label{sec:retinaoximetry}
\FloatBarrier
One of the key aims in this thesis is to utilise time-resolved fluorescence to map metabolic activity across the retina and so existing techniques of measuring metabolic activity should also be discussed. 
The presence of FAD in rat cortices has previously reported by \citeauthor{martinez2017understanding} where inducing acute hypoxia resulted in areas of hyper-fluorescence surrounding arteries and veins shown in \cref{fig:fadhalos2}. This demonstrates that changes in the metabolism of oxygen in the retina can be detected as changes in fluorescence associated with FAD.

    \caption{Both (a) and (b) show examples of fluorescence images recorded rat cortices after a short period of acute hypoxia, exhibiting characteristic `halos' of hyper-fluorescent FAD surrounding the vasculature. Increased FAD fluorescence is attributed to diffusion of arterial and venous oxygen into the retina to maintain metabolic function. Reproduced from Figure 3A and 3B from \citeauthor{martinez2017understanding}~\cite{martinez2017understanding}.}

Reproducing this result in the retina would be significant and indicate that measuring FAD could be useful marker for understanding the formation and progression of retinal disease.\\
Retinal oximetry is the most widely used technique for measuring metabolic activity in the retina where the differences in the absorption spectra between oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin can be leveraged to infer the oxygen saturation in the retinal vasculature. Implementations of retinal oximetry utilise a standard fundus camera but with a modified detection path where two detectors record spectral images, in parallel, with bands chosen to coincide with: the isobestic point, $\approx \qty{550}{\nm}$, where the absorption of oxygenation and deoxygenated haemoglobin is equal; and an oxygen sensitive band where the two spectra are maximally different~\cite{smith1999optimum,rilven2017retinal}. Similar implementations involve using three spectral bands but retinal oximetry using 8 spectral bands has also been demonstrated using \textbf{the} Image-Replicating Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) for snapshot oximetry using a single detector yielding high-spectral resolution, and sensitivity to changes in oxygenation~\cite{mackenzie2016vivo, mackenzie2018oximetry,choudhary2013assessment}. 
\textbf{While the large changes in oxygenation between normal and oxygen deprived conditions (hypoxia) can be resolved by the IRIS system, measuring year-on-year changes in oxygenation to track the progression of retinal disease~\cite{told2018method} becomes infeasible due to systematic errors: multi-path reflection from blood vessels~\cite{beach2024potential}; skin and fundus pigmentation~\cite{hirsch2023dual}; and patient-to-patient variability.}
