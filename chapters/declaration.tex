All work presented in this thesis was carried out by the author with one exception. The data sets used for the appraisal of the Phasor SFLIM algorithm described in \cref{sec:phasor-sflim} were constructed, and analysed, by the author. However Dr. Rui Wang (Southwest Jiaotong University) adapted the Phasor SFLIM code, provided in supplementary material of \citeauthor{scipioni2021phasor}\cite{scipioni2021phasor}, for unmixing fluorophores for SFLIM images.
The imaging experiments involving rats, presented in \cref{chap:ratfad}, were carried out in the labs of Prof. Ken Smith (Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London). Dr. Zhiyuan Yang (Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London) was responsible for all animal handling for these experiments.
For the \textit{ex-vivo} rabbit experiments, Dr. Erin Boland and John McAbney (both from School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow) assisted with the enucleation of eyes, as well as the cannulation of the external carotid artery, and decapitation, of recently sacrificed rabbits.\\
