All work presented in this thesis was carried out by the author with one exception. The data sets used for the appraisal of the Phasor SFLIM algorithm described in \cref{sec:phasor-sflim} were constructed, and analysed, by the author. However Dr. Rui Wang (Southwest Jiaotong University) adapted the Phasor SFLIM code, given in supplementary material of \citeauthor{scipioni2021phasor}\cite{scipioni2021phasor}, for unmixing fluorophores for SFLIM images.
